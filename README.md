# customer_transactions_history

The attached dataset contains three features about the customers of a business.
- Customer ID
- Product
- Time stamp

Our goal is to build a model to facilitate the analysis and prediction of the customer behavior and product dynamics. You're free to pick any architecture and any data model that you deem suitable. We're interested in models that deliver high accuracy and are ideally flexible and powerful enough for adding more features. Here are a few basic questions:

- Create a descending plot that shows the total number of transactions per customer. 
- Given any product ID, create a plot to show its transaction frequency per month for the year 2018. 
- Build a model to predict the total number of transactions for the next three months per customer anywhere in 2019. For example, given all data up to the end of January 2019, predict the size of the transactions between Feb 1st and April 30th for each customer. Then, measure the performance of your model with appropriate metrics and visuals. 
- At any time, what are the top 5 products that drove the highest sales over the last six months? Do you see a seasonality effect in this data set?

Feel free to state and solve any other questions that you find interesting about this data set. Attention to good coding practices and style will be noted. Also, feel free to implement more than one model and compare their performance.
